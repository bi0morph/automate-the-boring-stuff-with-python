# About
Once upon a time at Spring I bought a book "Automate The Boring Stuff With Python" with idea to learn something new and after year and a few months I found that I need a rest and that I have a bunch of books on the shelf that I didn't finish. So thats how I got a fun with python and simple ideas of automation things around. And yes - this repository contains some piece of code from that book.
